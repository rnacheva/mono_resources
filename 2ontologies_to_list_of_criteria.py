# Task
Extract categories and topics from the OWL and HTML files to be used for assessing digital accessibility in the workplace. Form 5 categories and in each of them assign at least 4 and no more than 10 criteria for evaluating digital accessibility. Also consider the following principles: Compliance with international standards and maintenance of organizational policies; Accessibility of digital content; Ensuring user experience related to user profile; Workplace integration; Opportunities for training and professional development. As a result, provide a list with all categories and 5 words per assigned criteria. Use the following files: "/content/full-ontology(Orange tool).html" and "/content/ontology-full-data-process.owl".

## Load and process the owl file

### Subtask:
Load the ontology file and extract relevant information, focusing on the structure and content that can inform accessibility criteria.

**Reasoning**:
Load the OWL file content and attempt to parse it to extract relevant information about accessibility concepts. Due to the complexity of OWL files, using a library like owlready2 is appropriate for proper parsing and structure analysis.

The traceback indicates a `TypeError` when trying to convert a `NoneType` to a float within the `owlready2` parsing process, specifically related to handling literals. This suggests there might be some data properties in the ontology with missing or incorrectly formatted values that `owlready2` is trying to interpret as numbers. While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact problematic data property without inspecting the ontology structure in detail, I can try to make the parsing more robust by handling potential errors during the extraction of comments or other properties that might contain such literals. I will modify the code to add error handling around accessing properties that might cause this issue, specifically focusing on the `comment` property as it was involved in the traceback.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The analysis successfully loaded and processed the OWL ontology file, extracting information about classes, including their names, IRIs, comments, subclasses, and relationships.
*   Based on the OWL ontology data and five predefined principles (Compliance with international standards and maintenance of organizational policies; Accessibility of digital content; Ensuring user experience related to user profile; Workplace integration; Opportunities for training and professional development), a set of potential criteria for assessing digital accessibility in the workplace was identified and categorized.
*   The initial categorization of criteria resulted in the following counts per category, all within the required range of 4 to 10:
    *   Compliance with international standards and maintenance of organizational policies: 4 criteria
    *   Accessibility of digital content: 6 criteria
    *   Ensuring user experience related to user profile: 5 criteria
    *   Workplace integration: 5 criteria
    *   Opportunities for training and professional development: 4 criteria
*   For each identified criterion, 5 representative keywords were manually selected based on the criterion's name and description.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The extracted criteria and associated keywords provide a foundational list for developing a digital accessibility assessment framework tailored to the workplace, aligned with key principles.
