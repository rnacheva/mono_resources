Given the lack of specific accessibility predicates in the sample, a broader approach of identifying subclasses of `owl:Class` or looking for specific keywords in labels or comments might be necessary. Iterate through the graph again, applying the refined condition to identify potential accessibility categories. Store the identified subjects (URIs) in the `accessibility_categories` set.
